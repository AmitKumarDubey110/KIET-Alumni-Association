# KIET-Alumni-Association

This is a website which is used to make the intraction between the KIET students and the KIET Alumni Students to have the key knowledge 
about the latest experiences and strugles in the company.

The main motive to built this website is to help and understand the corporate culture in a simple and easy ways.
I had made this so because the students have the exposer of the company life culture and the peer pressure as well as the limits and 
challeges to have the work done on the time.

I had done the forntend part only as its our live project and get developed in the teams.


Hope it will help you to have the greater experiences.
